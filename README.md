### About the Cheapmod Mini
The Cheapmod Mini is a low-cost modchip alternative for the Original Xbox. Based off the cheapmod schematics, the chip was made in a smaller form-factor while comprising of a single 49LF020 flash to store one 256k custom BIOS.

It allows the bypassing of most of the Xbox's security features and install a custom BIOS (e.g. Cerbios), region free capabilities for booting of imported and backup games, running homebrew applications, and various
other advantages over stock.

### Installation
[v1.0 - v1.2](https://github.com/m4x10187/cheapmod-mini/blob/main/diagrams/Cheapmod_Mini_v1-v12_Installation_Guide.pdf)

[v1.6/b](https://github.com/m4x10187/cheapmod-mini/blob/main/diagrams/Cheapmod_Mini_V1.6.jpg)

### Assembling the chip
Included in the repository are the gerber files and bill of materials so you can manufacturer your own Cheapmod Mini. Note that the PCB does not contain reference designators, so an image is provided to show the correct
component placement.

(The 49LF020 without any other variant will work with this chip)

PCB thickness must be 1.6mm.
